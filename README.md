# DartMUDlet

**<p bold align="center">A [Mudlet](https://www.mudlet.org/) package for playing [DartMUD](http://dartmud.com).</p>**

## Motivation
Returning to DartMUD after a 10 year absence, I found people were using Mudlet and discovered the excellent DartMUD LUA Scripts by missionz3r0. The game has changed a bit since they were last updated so I've picked them up to tweak patterns, fix typos, extend functionality and use GitHub's release feature to deliver the installable package.

## Screenshots
Screenshot soon....

## Features
DartMUDlet does a number of things for you automatically including the obvious visual items like a conversation window up top, your status persisted in the top right.  It also performs the all-important task of counting and reporting improves (for you and for pets), it handles delaying any new commands to the MUD when you are performing interruptable actions like spellcasting and scrollwork, and has many more features useful to DartMUD players.

## Installation
+ Head over to the project's [releases page](https://github.com/daviesow/dartmudlet/releases) and grab the latest package.zip under Assets.
+ Launch Mudlet and connect to your DartMUD profile.  
+ Open Mudlet's Package Manager, click Install and point it to your downloaded package.zip.
+ Finally, in the mud text entry box (lower left) issue `/setup` to get things rolling.

## How to use?
Aside from the automatic features described above, there are a few things you can control by entering directives in the mud's text entry box:

```
/setup - Initialize variables, customize the display, start improve tracking database.
/unsetup - Remove timers and triggers, deactivate display customizations.
/resetup - Remove then reinitialize timers, triggers, etc.  Makes changes to DartMUDLet active.
```
Some of the rest are:
```
/announce on      - Announce improvements in Brief mode (just a plus, no skill name revealed)
/announce verbose - Announce improvements including the full name of the skill
/announce off     - Stop announcing improvements
```
```
/antispam on|off - suppress repeated lines
```
```
/block   - Block any new commands from being sent to the MUD, queue them to be sent later.
           DartMUDlet usually does this for you when it detects the start of interuptable actions.
/unblock - Resume sending commands to the MUD starting with any that were queued while blocking.
           For when you MUST interrupt your previous action (e.g. to run from that dragon NOW).
```
```
/cast ! <spell> @ <power> <spell args> - Repeat practice casting a spell
/cast ! off                            - Stop practicing; remember spell and power
